The only data that is collected by this extension is the text of a Bluesky post after translation has been requested. The text of the post or its translation are not stored.

That data is transmitted along with the appropriate API key to the chosen translation provider.
No other transmission of data is conducted. 

This extension stores provided API keys (encrypted), the chosen target language and translation provider, and a prompt for LLM-based translation providers.
